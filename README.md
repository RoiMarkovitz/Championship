# Championship

The game was created for a project in the course "object-oriented programming in Java" at the academy.

I was asked to write a program that uses javafx in MVC format to manage the trophy competition. 


### Championship Game Description

The program offers 3 options to select the type of sport: Tennis, Basketball or soccer.

The user need to add 8 players to the competetion. once all 8 players are added he can start the competition.

After clicking the "Start Championship" button and provided the user has filled in all the names, a second screen will appear.
This screen allows to hold a round of games of the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. 
The user can enter the game data only if the participants are known. 

After clicking the "Play button", a window for receiving the game data will open. 
This window depends on the type of competition which was selected.

- In a tennis competition there will be 3 or 5 sets when a difference of 3 wins is required.
- In a basketball competition, 4 quarters of the game are recorded.
- In a football competition, results of 2 halves are recorded and if the result is a draw, you play one more halve, if is also a draw, then you get to play penalty kicks.
